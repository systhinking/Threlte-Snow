# Svelte/Threlte Flow Fields

A small project aimed at learning Threlte during the Warp2023 hackathon (<https://threlte.xyz/hackathon>).

## Objective

Use Threlte for the first time without too much pressure. Mainly interested in testing out a few things on the "WoW! Track", but also I might end up on the self "Aha! Track".

>The "Wow! Track" is a playground for innovation, creativity, and jaw-dropping visuals. We invite your to wow us with anything from games, immersive ui/ux prototypes, or a tech or business prototypes. The sky is the limit so we expect you to surprise and delight us!

---
>The "Aha! Track" is where you share the knowledge with the community. What did you miss when you were learning Threlte? Add that example that delights and explains, or a tutorial that gets you set up with the skills for your next project. Let's make Threlte easy and fun to learn!

## Plan

Simple and clean interactive flow fields using Threlte.

## Expectations

I don't expect to finish.
