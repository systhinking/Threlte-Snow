# Svelte/Threlte Flow Fields

A small project aimed at learning Threlte during the Warp2023 hackathon (<https://threlte.xyz/hackathon>).

## Objective

Use Threlte for the first time without too much pressure. Mainly interested in testing out a few things and learning a bit more by doing vs. watching.

## Plan

Simple and clean interactive gravity based flow fields, or maybe water simulator.

## Expectations

I don't expect to finish.
