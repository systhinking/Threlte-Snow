# Svelte/Threlte Flow Fields

A small project aimed at learning Threlte during the Warp2023 hackathon (<https://threlte.xyz/hackathon>).

## Objective

Use Threlte for the first time without too much pressure. Mainly interested in testing out a few things and learning a bit more by doing vs. watching.

## Plan

Simple and clean interactive gravity based flow fields, or maybe water simulator.

## Expectations

I don't expect to finish.

## Current Functionality

Right now only the reset and debug aspect of the UI work.
The reset button currently resets the collider layout/generation. Size varies on layout.
The debug checkmark is simply to show the colliders, since default = invisible.

## Indented

I meant for the UI to control various values, like collider size, which is just length of each side of the footprint (height gets a little crazy to do). Size of the particles, spawn rate and how long they last to start. Was going to get more UI fun stuff in there like gravity, and friction, etc.
